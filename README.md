# Barrier-Free Kiosk Software

This project provides a sample web kiosk application targeted at public health centers.
It focuses on accessibility so that visitors of all ages can easily check in,
make payments, print certificates and interact with an AI assistant.

## Features

- **Reception** – scan or manually enter resident registration information and
  receive a ticket number.
- **Payment** – simple payment form that loads recommended prescriptions from
  `data/treatment_fees.csv` and records payment details.
- **Certificate Issuance** – generates PDF prescriptions and medical
  confirmations. Korean text in the PDFs requires the NanumSquareNeo font.
- **AI Chatbot** – powered by Google Gemini to answer common questions.
- **Adjustable Font Size** and basic language support (Korean/English).

## Installation

1. **Prerequisites**
   - Python 3.8 or newer.
   - A terminal or command prompt.
   - A TrueType font file `NanumSquareNeo-bRg.ttf` placed in
     `app/static/fonts/NanumSquareNeo/NanumSquareNeo/TTF/` so PDF output shows Korean correctly.
     The font is included in this repository under that directory.

2. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/example/brfree.git
   cd brfree
   ```
   *(If not cloning, make sure the current directory is the project root.)*

3. **Create and activate a virtual environment** (recommended)
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Configure environment variables**
   The AI chatbot uses the Google Gemini API. Set your API key before running:
   - On Windows (Command Prompt)
     ```bash
     set GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
     ```
   - On Windows (PowerShell)
     ```bash
     $env:GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux
     ```bash
     export GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
     ```
   Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with the key you obtained from Google.

## Running the Application

After installing dependencies and setting the environment variable, start the
Flask development server:

```bash
python run.py
```

The kiosk will be available at <http://127.0.0.1:5001/>.

When generating PDFs, if `NanumSquareNeo-bRg.ttf` is missing you will see a warning in
the PDF and Korean characters may not render correctly. Ensure the font file is
present in `app/static/fonts/NanumSquareNeo/NanumSquareNeo/TTF/`.

## Kiosk Usage

The homepage (<http://127.0.0.1:5001/>) shows three main buttons.  Each button
corresponds to a Flask blueprint and service module:

1. **Reception – `routes/reception.py`**
   - Click **"접수(순번표)"** and choose the manual entry option to complete
     reception.
   - The `reception_service.py` functions handle the scan, manual input and
     symptom selection steps.  On completion a ticket number is issued and the
     patient's reservation status in `data/reservations.csv` is updated.

2. **Payment – `routes/payment.py`**
   - This option requires reception to be finished.  Navigate to
     `/payment/` and press **"처방 불러오기"**.  The service selects two or three
     prescriptions at random from `data/treatment_fees.csv` according to the
     chosen department.
   - After clicking **"현금 결제"** the payment is stored via
     `payment_service.py` and the reservation record is updated with the
     prescription list and total fee.

3. **Certificate Issuance – `routes/certificate.py`**
   - Once reception and payment are complete, the **"증명서 발급"** button shows
     options for **"처방전 발급"** and **"진료확인서 발급"**.  The appropriate
     PDF is generated by `certificate_service.py` and displayed in the browser.

Attempting payment or certificate issuance without finishing the previous steps
will redirect back to the required stage, as each service checks the current
reservation status.
